# The Real Story Behind VibeCoder

## How 17 Years Led to This Moment

They call me **VibeCoder**. I follow my curiosities wherever they lead. What started as "just another server to fix" at Cisco became a 17-year journey that ends with me building the interfaces people actually love.

Here's the real story.

### 🔧 Years 1-11: The Invisible Foundation (2008-2019)

**7 years at Cisco EMEA, Brussels.** Enterprise troubleshooting across Europe, Middle East, Africa. I was good at it. Really good.

**4 years leading IT at Fixzit.** Multiple client projects. Business operations. The works.

**The problem?** I was invisible. Infrastructure work means users never see you. They only notice when things break.

I wanted to build something people would actually *enjoy* using.

### 🏢 Years 12-16: Deep in the Backend (2019-2024)

**5+ years as System Engineer at acom NV.** Enterprise systems. Complex infrastructure. I understood the technical side inside and out.

But something was missing.

### 😤 The Awakening: CaptureTech CRM Hell (March-July 2024)

**This changed everything.**

First business development role after 16 years in technical positions. They gave me an old CRM system that killed my workflow. Every. Single. Day.

I'd sit there thinking: "I could build something 10x better than this garbage."

**That was my moment.** The frustration of using terrible software lit a fire in me.

### 🔍 The Eye-Opener: Elk Factory (August 2024-January 2025)

**Elite Elastic Partner.** Enterprise Search, Observability, Cybersecurity.

Here I discovered Elasticsearch. Sophisticated enterprise software that actually *worked*. Beautiful, powerful, elegant.

**Plot twist:** While doing business development, I was diving deep into the software side. Learning how the best enterprise tools are built.

This is what good software looks like.

### 🎯 The Final Straw: Relaxy (February-April 2025)

My last business development role. Learned their SaaS platform inside out. Conducted market research.

**The whole time I was thinking:** "I want to build solutions like this, not just sell them."

**The realization hit:** I was selling other people's solutions when I wanted to build my own.

### 🚀 The Switch: Frontend Developer (April 2025-Present)

**Open to work. Career transition.**

Built Stock2coat in 2 weeks to prove this is what I want to do full time.

## The Stock2coat Proof

> "You made this work like a dream, friend."  
> – Nicolas, using Stock2coat for the first time

My best friend of 25+ years. Excel chaos to production-ready app in 2 weeks.

**That's when I knew.** This is my calling.

## Why I'm Different

**Enterprise Backend + Business Operations + UX Frustration + Frontend Passion**

Most frontend developers haven't:
- Spent 10+ years in enterprise infrastructure
- Managed multiple client projects for 4 years
- Experienced the daily pain of terrible UX
- Been exposed to sophisticated enterprise software like Elasticsearch

**I have.**

## My Unfair Advantages

### 🔨 I Build Real Solutions
Stock2coat saves Nicolas 2 hours daily. Real impact, not toy projects.

### 💼 I Understand Business Impact
16 years in business operations. I know ROI matters more than perfect code.

### 🚀 I Use AI as My Superpower
Replit Agent, Bolt, Cursor. Why code boilerplate when AI handles it?

### 🎯 I Think Enterprise-Scale
From Cisco to Elasticsearch. I understand complexity and build for scale.

## The Stack That Powers Everything

**Frontend:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind  
**Backend:** Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express, Drizzle ORM  
**AI Tools:** Replit Agent, Bolt.new, Cursor, Claude  
**Enterprise:** Elasticsearch, enterprise systems, business processes

## What This Means for You

You're not hiring another frontend developer.

You're hiring someone who:
- Understands enterprise complexity (Cisco + acom NV + Elasticsearch)
- Knows business operations (Fixzit multi-client management)
- Has lived through UX hell (CaptureTech CRM nightmare)  
- Can build solutions that actually work (Stock2coat proof)

**The combination is rare.**

**Ready to build something extraordinary?**
