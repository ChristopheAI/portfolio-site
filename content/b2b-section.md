# Why B2B Companies Choose Me Over Other Frontend Developers

## Here's What 17 Years Taught Me About Enterprise Software

Most frontend developers build toy projects. I've lived in the enterprise trenches.

### 🔧 I Know How Enterprise Systems Actually Work

**Cisco EMEA, 7 years.** Enterprise troubleshooting across Europe, Middle East, Africa. When Fortune 500 systems broke, I fixed them.

**acom NV, 5+ years.** Deep system engineering. Complex enterprise infrastructure. The stuff that keeps businesses running.

**The difference?** I understand how your backend actually works. Not theory. Reality.

### 🏢 I've Managed Multiple Clients (Without Losing My Mind)

**Fixzit, 4 years as IT leader.** Multiple client projects simultaneously. Different needs, competing deadlines, constant communication.

**Here's what I learned:**
- How to prioritize when everything is "urgent"
- Client communication that actually works
- Delivering on time when budgets are tight

**Most frontend developers have never managed a single client.** I've managed dozens.

### 😤 I've Lived Through Your Users' Pain

**CaptureTech CRM hell.** 5 months using software that killed my workflow. Every. Single. Day.

Sitting there thinking: "I could build something 10x better than this garbage."

**That frustration?** It drives everything I build now. I've been your frustrated user.

### 🔍 I Know What Quality Enterprise Software Looks Like

**Elk Factory.** Elite Elastic Partner. Enterprise Search, Observability, Cybersecurity.

Discovered Elasticsearch. Sophisticated enterprise software that actually *worked*. Beautiful, powerful, elegant.

**Most developers have never seen enterprise-grade software.** I've worked with the best.

### 🚀 I Deliver Real Business Impact

**Stock2coat.** Built in 2 weeks. Saves Nicolas 2 hours daily. Cuts stockouts by 90%.

Excel chaos to production-ready solution. Real ROI, not vanity metrics.

## Why This Combination Is Impossible to Find

**Frontend developers usually have:**
- Technical skills but zero enterprise experience
- UX theory but never lived through bad software  
- Code knowledge but no business operations background
- Portfolio projects but no real business impact

**I have all four.**

## What This Actually Means for Your Company

### 🎯 I Understand Your Environment
17 years in enterprise infrastructure. I know:
- Why your systems are complex (they have to be)
- How things break (and how to prevent it)
- The difference between demos and production

### 💼 I Speak Your Language
4 years managing multiple clients taught me:
- How to prioritize competing demands
- Communication that doesn't waste time
- Delivering when budgets and deadlines are real

### 😤 I Build for Frustrated Users
CaptureTech CRM hell gave me:
- Real empathy for your users
- Understanding of workflow impact
- Motivation to solve actual problems

### 🔍 I Recognize Quality
Elasticsearch exposure showed me:
- What enterprise software should look like
- How sophisticated tools actually work
- Standards that matter in your industry

### 🚀 I Create Measurable Value
Stock2coat proves I can:
- Build production systems quickly
- Solve real business problems
- Generate actual ROI (2 hours saved = money saved)

## The Bottom Line

**You're not hiring another frontend developer.**

You're hiring someone who:
- **Understands enterprise complexity** (lived it for 17 years)
- **Can juggle multiple projects** (managed it for 4 years)
- **Empathizes with frustrated users** (been there, hated that)
- **Recognizes quality software** (worked with the best)
- **Delivers business value** (Stock2coat proof)

**This combination is rare in the frontend market.**

**Ready to work with someone who gets both sides?**
