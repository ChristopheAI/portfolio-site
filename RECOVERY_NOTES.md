## Incident: 2024-12-19 17:00
All project files were accidentally deleted during Vite setup when selecting "Remove existing files and continue".

## Lesson Learned:
- ALWAYS backup before running scaffolding tools
- Use manual Vite setup instead of automated wizard
- Create Vite in temp directory first, then merge

## Recovery Steps:
1. Recreate essential workflow files
2. Manual Vite setup
3. Restore project structure
4. Continue with TASK-001

## Files to Restore:
- [ ] CLAUDE.md (workflow system)
